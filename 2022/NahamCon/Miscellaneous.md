## Solution
After having the train run across my screen like 3 times, I realised that I had to run the `ls` command which was mentioned in the description right behind the ssh command used to connect to the server.

Ah, there we go. Now simply run the ssh command again but with cat flag.txt to obtain the flag.

When am I??

So, I look down at my watch. It's December 28, 2011 at 11:59AM, and I'm just minding my own business at -13.582075733990298, -172.5084838587106.
I hung out there until the local time was 1:00AM on December 31st, and then I hopped on a plane and took a 1 hour flight over to -14.327595989244111, -170.71287979386747.\
Some time has passed since I landed, and on December 30th, 12PM local time, I took a 1 hour flight back to my original location.
It's been 10 hours since I landed on my most recent flight - how many seconds have passed since I first looked at my watch?

(Submission format is flag{<number of seconds goes here>}, such as flag{600}.)
## Solution 
Oh god it's painful to do the calculations, but for the sake of this writeup ðŸ¤§
Firstly, it took me some googling to find out that he was "minding his own business" at Samoa, and he took a flight to and back from American Samoa throughout this challenge.
Now here's the big brain trick hidden in this challenge. At the end of 29 December 2011, Samoa lost a day. Yes, you saw that right. Samoa lost 30 December 2011 and skipped directly into 31 December 2011. Hence,

December 28 11.59am (Samoa) -> December 31 1:00am (Samoa): 133260 seconds\
1 hour plane to American Samoa -> 133260 + 3600 = 136860 seconds\
December 31 2:00am (Samoa) = December 30 1:00am (American Samoa)\
December 30 1:00am (American Samoa) -> December 30 12:00pm (American Samoa): 136860 + 39600 = 176460 seconds\
1 hour place back to Samoa -> 176460 + 3600 = 180060 seconds\
Another 10 hours since reaching Samoa -> 180060 + 36000 = 216060 seconds.

flag{216060}
## Thoughts
This was probably the most mindblowing challenge for me, so much respect for the big brain challenge creator @Kkevsterrr#7469 for thinking of it. Really enjoyed it a lot ðŸ˜†
